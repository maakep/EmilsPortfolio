Dimension Knight was made for the Castle Game Jam 2016 where in I made most of the graphics. The game was made in the Unity Engine and the models
were created, textured and animated in Blender. The two characters in the game are the Knight and the Dragon, which can be seen above. 
What is shown is the Knight walking aninmation, the Dragon flying animation, their untextured models and their texture maps (made in Photoshop).
This took about 2.5 days to make working full time.
