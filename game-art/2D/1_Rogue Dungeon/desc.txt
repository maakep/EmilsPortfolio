Rogue Dungeon was made for our Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Malmö Högskola. The game was made in the Unity Engine and all the art was made
using the pixel-art program PyxelEdit. These animations are the attack animation of three different characters, the Warrior, the Archer and the Skeleton.
