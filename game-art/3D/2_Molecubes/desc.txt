Molecubes was made for our final school gameproject at Malmö Högskola. The game was made in the Unreal Engine and the models were created and animated in Blender.
Materials and textures were added in the engine. These characters are the two different enemy types in game, the BoxBot and the ShooterBot. The BoxBot can walk
and smash your defense, while the ShooterBot moves using its tank treads and is equipped with a laser rifle. The models and animations took about 2-3 weeks
of half-time work to complete.
